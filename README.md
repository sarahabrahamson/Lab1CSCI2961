3.  The 10 criteria of Open Source are important because open source software has to be available to everyone. There canâ€™t be any restrictions on its distribution or modification, with the exception that the original may not be directly changed but new patches or modified versions are allowed to be distributed.

4.	Provide an example to help the person come to an answer by themselves.
	Ask them to explain to you what they have done for the question so far, and maybe they will notice their mistake. (aka be a rubber ducky)

9.  Congratulations!
    You solved this level with 13 lines of JavaScript:

while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
    moveForward();
  } else {
    if (isPathForward()) {
      moveForward();
    } else {
      turnLeft();
      turnLeft();
    }
  }
}

10. I will be searching the web for ideas for a project. I will also ask my friends if they have any ideas. Working on an existing Open Source project would probably benefit me more because I will learn more about how open source software works.
